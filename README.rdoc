= rubygems-mirror

http://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-mirror

== DESCRIPTION:

This is an update to the old `gem mirror` command. It uses net/http/persistent
and threads to grab the mirror set a little faster than the original.
Eventually it will replace `gem mirror` completely. Right now the API is not
completely stable (it will change several times before release), however, I
will maintain stability in master.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Fast mirroring
* Limited tests - just functional

== REQUIREMENTS:

* rubygems : use either sudo apt-get install rubygems (on Debian) or sudo gem install rubygems
* net/http/persistent: use sudo gem install net-http-persistent

== INSTALL:

* use gem install rubygems-mirror 
* or install from sources: clone this repo then run `rake mirror:update`

== USAGE

* In a file at ~/.gem/.mirrorrc add a config that looks like the following:

    ---
    - from: http://rubygems.org
      to: /data/rubygems
      parallelism: 10

* Then run `gem mirror`
