== DESCRIPTION:

This is an update to the old `gem mirror` command. It uses net/http/persistent
and threads to grab the mirror set a little faster than the original.
Eventually it will replace `gem mirror` completely. Right now the API is not
completely stable (it will change several times before release), however, I
will maintain stability in master.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Fast mirroring
* Limited tests - just functional

== REQUIREMENTS:

* rubygems
* net/http/persistent
* hoe

== USAGE

* In a file at ~/.gem/.mirrorrc add a config that looks like the following:

    ---
    - from: http://rubygems.org
      to: /data/rubygems
      parallelism: 10
      retries: 3
      delete: false 
      skiperror: true

* Either install the gem, then run `gem mirror`, or
* Clone then run `rake mirror:update`
* With the environment variable `RUBYGEMS_MIRROR_ONLY_LATEST=TRUE`,
  rubygems-mirror fetches only the latest release of each gem

== INSTALL:

* gem install rubygems-mirror
